## Summary

KanyeAI is a Discord chat bot that replies to the user with quotes from Kanye West. I made this for fun, and wanted to pick someone who was quite the character and could make for an interesting chat bot.

## Tools

- [Discord.js] - This is a JavaScript library which allows the game to run and create shape objects on the screen.
- [Replit] - Replit is an online code editor. I use this to keep my bot running without requiring any payment for upkeep.
- [UptimeRobot] - A website which continuously pings my replit code to keep running. This allows my bot to stay up 24/7.
- [Adobe Photoshop] - Photoshop was used to alter the image of Kanye.

## How to get KanyeAI in your server
Please use this discord link to add the bot to your server:

<https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=886685150178574367&permissions=274877910080&scope=bot%20applications.commands>

You might need to sign-in, and once you have done that you can pick what server to add KanyeAI to. :)

KanyeAI will respond to various messages such as "hey kanye" in the text channels he is given access to.
